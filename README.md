TechCon 2025 – HTML Conference Website
This project is a multi-page HTML website built for the ALX Frontend Foundations curriculum. Its purpose is to help learners practice structuring complete websites using only HTML, without CSS or JavaScript. The website represents a fictional technology conference called TechCon 2025 and includes five fully functional pages.

The website contains the following pages:

• Homepage (index.html) – Introduces the TechCon 2025 conference and includes a promotional video.
• About Page (about.html) – Describes the history, mission, and background of the conference.
• Schedule Page (schedule.html) – Displays the full event schedule using a well-organized HTML table.
• Register Page (register.html) – Contains a registration form where users can sign up for the event.
• Contact Page (contact.html) – Provides contact information, social links, a map, and a contact form.

Throughout this project, various HTML concepts are applied, including semantic structure using header, nav, main, article, section, and footer elements. The project also demonstrates the use of internal links, multimedia embedding, tables for structured data, and form handling with different input types.

The goal of this project is to build strong foundational skills in HTML, focusing on structure, readability, and accessibility before moving on to styling and interactivity in future lessons.
